# 771. Jewels and Stones (easy)

# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

# Example 1:

# Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
# Output: 3 -->

        """check if stones are jewels"""

        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jewels:
